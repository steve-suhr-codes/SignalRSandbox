# SignalR Sandbox
A sandbox for playing around with SignalR.
Originally started with https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/tutorials/signalr?view=aspnetcore-6.0&tabs=visual-studio-mac. 

From there, added a pointless server side clock that uses a hosted service to push down the latest time at a regular interval.
